      <p>
        Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at
        number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the
        early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew
        Harry’s room.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If you can’t
        control that owl, it’ll have to go!”
      </p>
      <p>Harry tried, yet again, to explain.</p>
      <p>
        ‘She’s bored,’ he said. ‘She’s used to flying around outside. If I could
        just let her out at night ...’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Do I look stupid?’ snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling
        from his bushy moustache. ‘I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let out.’
      </p>
      <p>He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.</p>
      <p>
        Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud
        belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.
      </p>
      <p>‘I want more bacon.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,’ said Aunt Petunia, turning
        misty eyes on her massive son. We must feed you up while we’ve got the
        chance ... I don’t like the sound of that school food ...’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,’ said
        Uncle Vernon heartily. ‘Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the
        kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.
      </p>
      <p>‘Pass the frying pan.’</p>
      <p>‘You’ve forgotten the magic word,’ said Harry irritably.</p>
      <p>
        The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was
        incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook
        the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her
        hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in
        his temples.
      </p>
      <p>‘I meant “please”!’ said Harry quickly. ‘I didn’t mean –’</p>
      <p>
        ‘WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,’ thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the
        table, ‘ABOUT SAYING THE M WORD IN OUR HOUSE?’
      </p>
      <p>‘But I –’</p>
      <p>
        ‘HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!’ roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table
        with his fist.
      </p>
      <p>‘I just –’</p>
      <p>
        ‘I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER
        THIS ROOF!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was
        trying to heave Dudley to his feet.
      </p>
      <p>‘All right,’ said Harry, ‘all right...’</p>
      <p>
        Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and
        watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had
        been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because
        Harry wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as
        it is possible to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry Potter was a wizard – a wizard fresh from his first year at
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were
        unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry
        felt.
      </p>
      <p>
        He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomach ache.
        He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his
        lessons (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the post
        arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his
        four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid,
        in his cabin in the grounds next to the Forbidden Forest and,
        especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world
        (six tall goalposts, four flying balls and fourteen players on
        broomsticks).
      </p>
      <p>
        All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron and top-of the-range
        Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the
        stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the
        Dursleys care if Harry lost his place in the house Quidditch team
        because he hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if
        Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys
        were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their
        veins) and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family
        was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s
        owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her carrying messages to anyone in
        the wizarding world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
        and neckless, with an enormous black moustache; Aunt Petunia was
        horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink and porky. Harry, on the
        other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and
        jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his
        forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a
        wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of
        the reason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the age of one, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest
        dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and
        wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’s
        attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow –
        nobody understood why – Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
        instant he had failed to kill Harry.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her
        husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding
        why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the
        Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash which had
        killed his parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the
        whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school,
        where he and his scar were famous ... but now the school year was over,
        and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated
        like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be Harry’s
        twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never
        given him a proper present, let alone a cake – but to ignore it
        completely ...
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,
        ‘Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.’
      </p>
      <p>Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.</p>
      <p>
        ‘This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,’ said
        Uncle Vernon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle
        Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He’d been talking of
        nothing else for a fortnight. Some rich builder and his wife were coming
        to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him
        (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills).
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I think we should run through the schedule one more time,’ said Uncle
        Vernon. ‘We should all be in position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you
        will be –?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘In the lounge,’ said Aunt Petunia promptly, ‘waiting to welcome them
        graciously to our home.’
      </p>
      <p>‘Good, good. And Dudley?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘I’ll be waiting to open the door.’ Dudley put on a foul, simpering
        smile. ‘May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?’
      </p>
      <p>‘They’ll love him!’ cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.</p>
      <p>
        ‘I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,’
        said Harry tonelessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Exactly,’ said Uncle Vernon nastily. ‘I will lead them into the lounge,
        introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen –’
      </p>
      <p>‘I’ll announce dinner,’ said Aunt Petunia.</p>
      <p>‘And Dudley, you’ll say –’</p>
      <p>
        ‘May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?’ said Dudley,
        offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.
      </p>
      <p>‘My perfect little gentleman!’ sniffed Aunt Petunia.</p>
      <p>‘And you?’ said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.</p>
      <p>
        ‘I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,’ said
        Harry dully.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at
        dinner. Petunia, any ideas?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason ... Do tell me
        where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ...’
      </p>
      <p>‘Perfect ... Dudley?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘How about: “We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr.
        Mason, and I wrote about you.”’
      </p>
      <p>
        This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst
        into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so
        they wouldn’t see him laughing.
      </p>
      <p>‘And you, boy?’</p>
      <p>Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.</p>
      <p>
        ‘I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,’ he
        said.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Too right you will,’ said Uncle Vernon forcefully. ‘The Masons don’t
        know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. When dinner’s
        over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and
        I’ll bring the subject round to drills. With any luck, I’ll have the
        deal signed and sealed before the News at Ten. We’ll be shopping for a
        holiday home in Majorca this time tomorrow.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t think the Dursleys
        would like him any better in Majorca than they did in Privet Drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Right – I’m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and
        me. And you,’ he snarled at Harry, ‘you stay out of your aunt’s way
        while she’s cleaning.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He
        crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench and sang under his
        breath, ‘Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...’
      </p>
      <p>
        No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending
        not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so
        lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing
        Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione
        Granger. They, however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of
        them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was
        going to ask Harry to come and stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage
        by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it
        wasn’t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use magic
        outside school. Harry hadn’t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only
        their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped
        them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and
        broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed
        muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing
        out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long
        silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the
        magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal – and now
        Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
        What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or
        wizard? He’d almost be glad of a sight of his arch-enemy, Draco Malfoy,
        just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of
        last term, Harry had come face to face with none other than Lord
        Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he
        was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.
        Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it
        had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking
        in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now,
        remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring
        absent-mindedly into the hedge – and the hedge was staring back. Two
        enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the
        lawn.
      </p>
      <p>‘I know what day it is,’ sang Dudley, waddling towards him.</p>
      <p>The huge eyes blinked and vanished.</p>
      <p>
        ‘What?’ said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had
        been.
      </p>
      <p>‘I know what day it is,’ Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Well done,’ said Harry. ‘So you’ve finally learned the days of the
        week.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Today’s your birthday,’ sneered Dudley. ‘How come you haven’t got any
        cards? Haven’t you even got friends at that freak place?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,’ said Harry
        coolly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Why’re you staring at the hedge?’ he said suspiciously. ‘I’m trying to
        decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,’ said Harry.
      </p>
      <p>Dudley stumbled backwards at once, a look of panic on his fat face.</p>
      <p>
        ‘You c-can’t – Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic – he said he’ll
        chuck you out of the house – and you haven’t got anywhere else to go –
        you haven’t got any friends to take you –’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Jiggery pokery!’ said Harry in a fierce voice. ‘Hocus pocus ...
        squiggly wiggly ...’ ‘MUUUUUUM!’ howled Dudley, tripping over his feet
        as he dashed back towards the house. ‘MUUUUM! He’s doing you know what!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge
        was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but
        he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the
        soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he
        wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice creams, Harry cleaned
        the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds,
        pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench. The sun
        blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn’t
        have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry
        had been thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any friends at
        Hogwarts ...
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now,’ he thought savagely, as
        he spread manure on the flowerbeds, his back aching, sweat running down
        his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard
        Aunt Petunia calling him.
      </p>
      <p>‘Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!’</p>
      <p>
        Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the
        fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and
        sugared violets. A joint of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!’ snapped Aunt Petunia,
        pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen
        table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he
        had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. ‘Upstairs! Hurry!’
      </p>
      <p>
        As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of
        Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow-ties and dinner jackets. He had only just
        reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon’s
        furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.
      </p>
      <p>‘Remember, boy – one sound ...’</p>
      <p>
        Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door
        and turned to collapse on his bed.
      </p>
      <p>The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.</p>
